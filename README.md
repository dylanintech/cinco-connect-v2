# Introducing the cinco connect beta :school:

## stop using your school's site to stay connected

### cinco connect is an app that allows you to know what's coming up at school without having to navigate their native site.

## why :question:
### Well, I've always felt annoyed whwn I'm looking for something on my school's website and I keeep coming up against blockers, such as the contact information for my AP being super nested and difficult to find. Most of these issues lie in UX/UI problems, more specifially, they lie in the complexity of site. This is why I decided to build a minimalist, simple app where you can easily find what you want, when you want it.

## what's the roadmap :car:
### I build the alpha for the area leadership conference back in January, since then I've dramatically improved the UI and built a landing page + feedback form to initialize the iteration cycle!
